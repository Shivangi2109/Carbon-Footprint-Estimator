# Carbon-Footprint-Estimator
The Carbon Footprint Estimator is a regression-based machine learning project that predicts a person's weekly CO₂ emissions (in kilograms) based on their lifestyle choices—like diet, transportation, and electricity usage. It aims to:<br>
<br>
1.Promote awareness about environmental impact<br>
2.Help users understand how their choices contribute to carbon emissions<br>
3.Suggest areas for lifestyle improvement<br>

# Features & Flow:<br>
## Exploratory Data Ananlysis:<br>
1.Check for duplicates<br>
2.Check for missing values<br>
3.Check variables' types<br>
4.Check the unique values<br>
5.Use Label Encoding for categorical variables<br>
6.Plot the correlation matrix as a heatmap with colors<br>

## Model Training:<br>
Model: A RandomForestRegressor was selected for its robustness and ability to handle mixed data types.<br>
Trained on input features to predict weekly CO₂ output.<br>
Out-of-Bag validation helps assess model performance on unseen data.<br>

## Model Evaluation:<br>
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures prediction error magnitude.<br>
R² Score: Indicates how much variance in carbon output is explained by the model.<br>
Out-of-Bag (OOB) Score: Internal accuracy metric using unused samples during bootstrapping.<br>

## Visual output: <br>
Feature importance graph to show what affects predictions most.<br>

## Output:<br>
Predicted weekly CO₂ emissions (in kg).<br>

# Dependencies<br>
pandas – for data loading and preprocessing.<br>
numpy – for numerical operations.<br>
matplotlib & seaborn – for visualizing feature importance.<br>
scikit-learn – for model training, evaluation, and preprocessing (LabelEncoder, RandomForest, MSE, R²).<br>
